# LaTeX-Assignment-Templates

## Introduction

These are the customized templates for assignments by doowzs at Nanjing University. 

The original template was the Problem Solving Homework template by my teacher @hengxin (which course and who opened the door of the TeX world for me).

## How to Use

Each template comes with a Makefile. You can run ``make`` to compile and open the outcome pdf. If you want to compile manually, be sure to use XeLaTeX.
